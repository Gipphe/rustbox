# Rustbox

Rustbox is a Rust implementation of [termbox](http://github.com/nsf/termbox).

Currently, this is just a wrapper of the C library by nsf, though my plan is to convert it to be a pure Rust implementation and remove the requirement on the C library.

The original implementation of this was inspired by [Aaron Pribadi](http://github.com/apribadi/rust-termbox), so big props to him for the original work.
